## TDD with Mocha test runner/test framework and Chai assertion library

[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a feature-rich JavaScript test framework running on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. 

[Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
